        <h3>INDIAN RAILWAY</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Indian Railways (IR) is an government agency under
             the ownership of Ministry of Railways that operates
              India's national railway system. It manages the
               fourth-largest railway network in the world by 
               size, with a route length of 67,956 km (42,226 mi)
                as of 31 March 2020. 45,881 km (28,509 mi) or 71%
                 of all the broad-gauge routes are electrified
                  with 25 kV 50 Hz AC electric traction as of
                   1 April 2020.[4][5]</p>
<br>
          <p>In the fiscal year ending March 2020,
               IR carried 808.6 crore (8.086 billion)
                passengers and transported 121.22 crore
                 (1.2122 billion) tonnes of freight.[4]
                  IR runs 13,169 passenger trains daily
                  , on both long-distance and suburban routes,
                   covering 7,325 stations across India.[4] 
                   Mail or Express trains, the most common 
                   types of trains, run at an average speed of
                    50.6 km/h (31.4 mph). Suburban EMUs run at
                     an average speed of 37.5 km/h (23.3 mph).
                      Ordinary passenger trains (incl. mixed) 
                      run at an average speed of 33.5 km/h
                       (20.8 mph).[4] The maximum speed of
                        passenger trains varies, with the Vande
                         Bharat Express running at a peak speed
                          of 180 km/h (110 mph).
